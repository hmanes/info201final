####### **Executive Summary:**
######## Gentrification is a process of mass displacement of people by the means of developing low-income areas to appeal to a more lucrative population. Gentrified low-income neighborhoods become unaffordable for residents below the poverty line, thus, leading to wealthier, less diverse communities to move into these neighborhoods. Within gentrification, the combination of the two datasets ‘Gentrification Index Data for NYC" (for the year 2000) and "Gentrification and demographic analysis — 2000 to 2017" (where NYC in the year 2020 alone will be analyzed), attempt to answer the question: How does an increase in educational opportunities and focus on equity within this space across white and non-white populations translate to an increase in household median income? Through the cleaning and filtering of the original data sets, a new merged dataset, “gentrification_data.csv,” was created for further analysis. Using the package tidyverse and its tools dyplr and ggplot2, two summary tables and three plots were created to further analyze the breakdown of white vs. non-white populations, income, and educational attainment (see below). From these summary tables and plots, it can be concluded that over the past 20 years there has been an increase in educational attainment, a decrease in the white population, and a strong positive correlation between acquiring educational attainment and median income. As the data was rather limiting, it’s a bit difficult to demonstrate an all-encompassing perspective on gentrification, however, the data strongly supports the notion that through further funding and supporting the educational systems of gentrified communities, the prospects of such communities will drastically increase.Based on the findings, it is imperative to have policymakers and educators to invest more in their gentrified communities and their respective education systems, as the economy can only improve from a more educated population. There are numerous economical benefits from shifting a focus on gentrification/urban development to educational attainment as there will be an increase in highly-skilled workers who can contribute more to the flow of commerce and public funding.
